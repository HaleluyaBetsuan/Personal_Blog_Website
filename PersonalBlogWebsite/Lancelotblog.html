            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>
                 One could say that <strong>Lancelot</strong>  is the scariest character of the four. 
                Not because he is super strong or aggressive, but because he is extremely
                intelligent and will not hesitate to use it against anyone he considers
                hostile. Even his friends are unsure how honest he is or if he is just 
                a major manipulator. However Lancelot is mostly friedndly and will
                do absolutely nothing to hurt you if you've done nothing to him. <em>Mostly</em>.

            <p><u>Lancelot:</u> <q>Scary? That's the first time I have been 
                described like that. I try not to be.</q></p>
