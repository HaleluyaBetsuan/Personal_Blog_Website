            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Solis</strong> could be described as that one friend that's always super calm,
                because he can't control himself if he falls over the edge. He is 
                a destructive character who does not know what he is doing until 
                it's over. Despite being such angry person, he only really has one
                reason to get angry and that's when you hurt the people he cares about.
            </p>
            <p><u>Solis:</u> <q>I think a lot better when I am calmer, anyway
                 I don't like when myself when I get angry.</q></p>
